# Learning DotNet Core with Examples

This project is created as an example for a video tutorial of mine about dotnet core. Once the video is published, the link will be put here.

This code covers the following aspects in DotNet Core:

1. A simple project structure.
2. Adding project references to projects.
3. Using reflection API.
4. Reading XML files.
5. Parsing XML content into a `XmlDocument`.
6. Creating a simple pipeline using dotnet core.
